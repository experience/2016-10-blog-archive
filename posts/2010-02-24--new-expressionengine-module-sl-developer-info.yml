# New ExpressionEngine Module: SL Developer Info #
A couple of days ago, whilst hunting through an old ExpressionEngine site, searching for the short name of a custom field, I finally cracked.

_"There's got to be an easier way to do this."_, I bleated, pathetically.

Well, now there is. [SL Developer Info](/resources/details/sl-developer-info "Visit the SL Developer Info documentation and download page") is a new module that collates all the Weblog, Template, and File Upload Preference information you need when developing an ExpressionEngine site, and makes it available in one location.

No more hunting forlornly through the Administration section, or faffing about with Template preferences. Just open SL Developer Info, and you're done.

If you're an ExpressionEngine developer, chances are you left several paragraphs ago to visit [the documentation and download page](/resources/details/sl-developer-info "Visit the SL Developer Info documentation and download page"), and are already mid-way through installing the module.

If you're not an ExpressionEngine developer, chances are you left several paragraphs ago because none of this means anything to you.

Either way, it's time I stopped typing.
