# Franchising Creativity: A System for Better Web Design #
[Last time out](/blog/archive/reliable-service-business-processes "Previous waffle") I made a few general points about the value of clearly defined processes, particularly when you're employing sub-contractors (or in my case, when you _are_ the sub-contractor).

As part of that post, I mentioned [Michael E. Gerber](http://www.e-myth.com/pub/htdocs/aboutmeg.html "Did not appear in Marathon Man"), and his rather long-winded but very interesting book ["E-Myth Revisited."](http://www.amazon.co.uk/E-myth-Revisited-Michael-E-Gerber/dp/0887307280/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/203-2042511-1257511?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1182530268&sr=8-1 "Still available from Amazon") This got me thinking about Gerber's insistence that every business treat itself as a "franchise", by defining clear, simple, and easily replicated steps for _everything_.

The general idea is not to turn your friendly neighbourhood web agency into the pixel-pushing equivalent of [McDonalds](http://www.mcdonalds.com/ "The world's most successful cholesterol peddlers"), with millions of identical branches around the world, but to minimise your reliance upon skilled individuals. By making your systems do the hard work, the entire business won't fall apart if your entire staff has an off day. Plus, when you need to find a new employee, you aren't under pressure to find (and pay through the nose for) the best of the best in order for your business to succeed.

So how does this fit in with the role of the designer? Pretty well, in my opinion.

## Not designing by numbers
Many designers would balk at the thought that a set of simple processes could level the playing field between someone who is naturally gifted, and someone considerably less talented. So before I get thrown out of the Guild of Designers (or GoDs, as we like to be known), let me make it clear that I'm not suggesting that systems are a _replacement_ for creativity.

Instead, what I am saying is that good systems actively facilitate creativity. Here's how:

## A system can help you define the problem
Design is nothing more than creative problem-solving. In order to solve a problem, you first need to clearly define and understand it. You need to know what the constraints are, and what the criteria for success will be. A clearly defined system can help you do that.

## A system can solve the problem for you
Most web sites need to address at least a couple of problems for which tried-and-tested solutions already exist. A system (in conjunction with your code and / or design library) can provide solutions to these common problems, and ensure consistently high quality, by removing the need (or temptation) to reinvent the wheel for every project.

## A system can help you solve the problem
Sadly, design isn't (just) about sitting around sipping frothy coffee, and waiting for inspiration to strike. It's about systematically working through problems, and--more often than not--slogging it out. Sure, there are little moments of "inspiration" in every project, but they're generally a result of persistence and hard work.

Good processes provide (sometimes only subconscious) reassurance that the project as a whole is under control, enabling the designer to focus his full attention on the problem in hand, which naturally leads to better solutions.

## In conclusion
Franchising your design process won't remove the need for creativity and design ability, but it will make the whole job easier, and produce more consistent results.
