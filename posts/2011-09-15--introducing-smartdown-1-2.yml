# Introducing SmartDown 1.2 #
It's not often that I decide an add-on [point release][point_release] warrants a blog post, but the latest version of [SmartDown][smartdown_home] is a bit more than your typical array of minor bug fixes.

[point_release]:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_release "Proof positive that my version numbering system is nonsense"
[smartdown_home]:/software/smartdown "Smarter Markdown for ExpressionEngine"

## Easier EE code samples
A boatload of behind-the-scenes changes has resulted in much more reliable (and predictable) Markdown rendering, particularly when dealing with ExpressionEngine code examples within your content.

In the past something like could be a complete pain, with double-encoded curly-braces, and all manner of similar headaches:

```html
{exp:channel:entries channel='mrw'}
    {if '{lunch}' == 'pizza'}
        <blockquote>Jews like pizza</blockquote>
    {/if}
{/exp:channel:entries}
```


Not any more. SmartDown automatically fixes your code samples, without any additional faffing about.

## More flexible configuration
Previous versions of SmartDown required you to specify your preferred formatting options in every `{exp:smartdown}` template tag.

Worse than that, if you used SmartDown as the field formatting option for your custom field (the easiest way of using SmartDown), you couldn't specify any formatting options _at all_.

SmartDown 1.2 fixes both of these shortcomings, by allowing you to specify default settings in your `config.php` file. Want to disable SmartyPants across the board? Easy:

```php
$config['smartdown'] = array(
    'disable:smartypants' => 'yes'
);
```


## Custom extension hooks
Finally, SmartDown 1.2 introduces [two extension hooks][smartdown_hooks], which can be used to manipulate content before and after SmartDown processing. Perfect if you need to do some custom pre-processing, or tidy up content after the fact.

As ever, [the SmartDown documentation][smartdown_docs] has complete configuration and usage information. If you have any questions or suggestions, please [let me know][smartdown_support].
