# Hull Digital Live 2012 #
The [Hull Digital Live][hdlive] conference is back for another installment, on 1st November 2012.

This will be the third HD Live conference, and it's maturing nicely into one of the UK's best technology conferences. So much so that this year [we're sponsoring the event][hdlive_friends], in a very minor way.

Previous years have delivered excellent talks from the likes of [Anand Verma][anand], [Brendan Dawes][brendan], and some chap called [Simon Collison][colly]. Indeed, [Matthew Irvine Brown][mib]'s 2010 talk still sticks in my mind as one of the best I've ever seen.

HD Live alumni will know what to expect, with [this year's impressive speakers list][hdlive_speakers] promising another heady blend of business and technology know-how.

As ever, HD Live is in the [capable hands][hdlive_jj] of John "Def" Moss, and John "Barbour" Connolly.

What can you say about the Jo(h)ns that hasn't already been covered in "50 Shades of Grey"? Only that they give good conference.

You should [buy your ticket now][hdlive_buy], and find out first hand.
