# Interviewed by Snipcart #
A few weeks ago, we updated the shopping cart and checkout on the venerable [Iconic Interiors website][iconic]. Iconic is still running on ExpressionEngine 1 so our options were pretty limited.

Thankfully, [Snipcart][snipcart] came to our rescue, transforming the rather onerous (and time-consuming) process of implementing a shopping cart, and integrating with a payment provider, into a swift and pleasurable experience.

As such, when Snipcart asked me if I'd like to have a chat with them as part of their "Geek Talk" series, I was more than happy to oblige. The interview covers such exciting topics as my favourite superhero, and we even find time to discuss some developer-type things.

So, if you've ever wondered what my favourite quote is, now is [your chance to find out][snipcart-blog].
