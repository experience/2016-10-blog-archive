# Updates and Oddments : August 2012 #
It's been 12 month since [the previous Updates and Oddments post][previous_oddments]. I haven't been completely idle during this time, but my rather erratic blogging schedule means that most of my side projects are released without fanfare.

Read on for a collection of ExpressionEngine-related oddments that quietly slipped out the back door over the past year.

[previous_oddments]: /blog/updates-and-oddments "Previously on Flotsam and Jetsam"

## Add-on updates
Most of my "main" add-ons have received significant attention since the previous round-up post. Here are some of the forgotten highlights.

### [Campaigner][campaigner]
Campaigner has [progressed steadily][campaigner_changelog] from version 4.0.0 to version 4.5.0, with nary a Tweet for its trouble.

Most releases have focussed on making Campaigner play nicely with others, resulting in a couple of [handy new extension hooks][campaigner_hooks], and compatibility with CartThrob, Zoo Visitor, and Membrr, [among others][campaigner_third_party].

[campaigner]: /software/campaigner "Mercilessly member marketing"
[campaigner_changelog]: /software/campaigner/changelog "I remember when all this was custom fields"
[campaigner_hooks]: /software/campaigner/docs/campaigner-extension-hooks "Extension on the extension"
[campaigner_third_party]: /software/campaigner/docs/campaigner-compatibility "Bring it in to hug harbour"

### [Crumbly][crumbly]
Crumbly has also received some love, with a new [`reverse_breadcrumbs` tag parameter][crumbly_template_tags], and improvements to the way in which it "humanises" URL-encoded strings.

[crumbly]: /software/crumbly "All roads lead to home"
[crumbly_template_tags]: /software/crumbly/docs/crumbly-template-tags "Crumbly template tag documentation"

### [OmniLog][omnilog]
Along with [Testee][testee], OmniLog is the add-on that I most rely on in my day-to-day work, a fact reflected in the amount of attention both receive.

Over the past 12 months, OmniLog has [progressed steadily][omnilog_changelog] (if somewhat unspectacularly), primarily with improvements to the pagination and filtering of results.

[omnilog]: /software/omnilog "The system-wide message log, for use by ExpressionEngine add-on developers"
[omnilog_changelog]: /software/omnilog/changelog "Improving by increments"
[testee]: /software/testee "Test-driven add-on development made easy"

### [SmartDown][smartdown]
SmartDown 1.2 was such a (comparatively) significant release that it warranted [its own blog post][smartdown_120]; quite the achievement for a point release.

Since then, SmartDown has been upgraded with new [template tag parameters][smartdown_usage], and a very handy [SmartDown Images extension][smartdown_extras]. The latter uses SmartDown's [extension hooks][smartdown_hooks] to implement support for the "Matrix and NSM Transplant" [image replacement technique][smartdown_ir].

[smartdown]: /software/smartdown "Smarter markdown"
[smartdown_120]: /blog/introducing-smartdown-1-2 "Get Mr. Fancy Pants point release"
[smartdown_extras]: /software/smartdown/docs/smartdown-extras "SmartDown's bit on the side"
[smartdown_hooks]: /software/smartdown/docs/smartdown-extension-hooks "Wish SmartDown used TextPattern? You're an idiot, but this may help."
[smartdown_ir]: http://vimeo.com/18661374 "A moving picture show! The devil's work!"
[smartdown_usage]: /software/smartdown/docs/smartdown-usage "The bit you neglected to read before sending me that support request"

## GitHub-only oddments
Of course, not everything scales the dizzying heights of [the Software section][software]. Much of the code I write barely makes it off my machine, and even then it typically only travels as far as [GitHub][github_experience].

Nevertheless, there is _some_ useful stuff lurking in those repositories...

[software]: /software "My ramshackle add-on A-Team"
[github_experience]: https://github.com/experience/ "The detritus of my development life"

### [MailChimp Subscribe][mcs_repo]
Yes, I realise [MailChimp Subscribe][mcs] is one of [the chosen few][software], but there hasn't been an official release for a long time.

One of the reasons is that I've never really used [MailChimp][mailchimp] that much, and therefore have little motivation to update MailChimp Subscribe. As such MailChimp Subscribe has long been clothed in [Campaigner's][campaigner] hand-me-downs.

With the release of Campaigner 4.0 such code-sharing became impractical, and since then MailChimp Subscribe has mostly assumed the coveted role of "why did I ever release this bloody thing?".

However, just because I'm a terrible parent doesn't mean that MailChimp Subscribe is completely unloved. Several [helpful][github_pv] [souls][github_rsan] have forked [the repo][mcs_repo] and made significant improvements, including better support for third-party add-ons such as CartThrob and Zoo Visitor.

Eventually these updates may find their way into an official release, or perhaps MailChimp Subscribe will be officially relegated to GitHub. For now though, [the repo][mcs_repo] is significantly more up-to-date than [the official release][mcs].

[mcs]: /software/mailchimp-subscribe "The under-stairs abode of my least favourite offspring"
[mcs_repo]: https://github.com/experience/mailchimp_subscribe.ee_addon "Free to a good home"
[mailchimp]: http://mailchimp.com/ "The chimp to my chump"
[github_pv]: https://github.com/pvledoux "Suspiciously French, but isn't"
[github_rsan]: https://github.com/rsanchez "Disappointingly American, and is"

### [Author Info][author_info]
In my experience, every ExpressionEngine site has at least one or two tricky problems that can't be solved out the box, and for which no third-party solutions exist.

[A recent project][pku_connect] had more than its fair share of such challenges. This resulted in 8 custom add-ons, solving problems ranging from [the incredibly simple][you_are_here], to the considerably more complex.

Languishing somewhere in the middle of this scale is [Author Info][author_info]. Author Info retrieves information about the author of a Channel Entry, and makes it available through custom template variables.

View [the README][author_info_readme] for full usage instructions.

[you_are_here]: https://github.com/experience/you_are_here.ee_addon "So simple even Laisvunas wouldn't charge for it"

### [Simple Commerce Developer][scd]
Developing an extension that works with the Simple Commerce module's [extension hooks][sc_hooks] is painful. Part of this is due to the module itself, but the [PayPal Developer Sandbox][paypal_sandbox] deserves most of the credit for this particular circle of hell.

This is where the [Simple Commerce Developer module][scd] comes in.

Simple Commerce Developer lets you generate realistic IPN notifications at the push of a button, completely circumventing PayPal and making it much easier to test your extensions.

If you've never had to extend the Simple Commerce module in this manner, you're probably wondering why I'd even waste my time building such a thing. Everyone else is already downloading the ZIP.
