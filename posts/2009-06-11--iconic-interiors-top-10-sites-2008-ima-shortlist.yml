# Iconic Interiors Shortlisted for &quot;Top 10 Sites of 2008&quot; Interactive Media Award #
A few months back, IconicInteriors.com -- a site [we designed and built](/work/detail/iconic-interiors/ "Read more about the Iconic Interiors project") -- received a "Best in Class" Interactive Media Award. You may remember me [bragging shamelessly](/blog/archive/interactive-media-award-winner/ "Read more about our Interactive Media Award for IconicInteriors.com") about it.

Well, it turns out that the IMA judges liked the Iconic site so much that it's on their ["Top 10 sites of 2008" shortlist](http://www.interactivemediaawards.com/winners/2008/top10sites.asp "The 36 shortlisted sites").

Now if we can just beat BMW, Porsche, Maserati (twice), Volkwagen, Amnesty International, the Worldwide Fund for Nature, the Smithsonian, and MSN, it's in the bag.

Ah.
