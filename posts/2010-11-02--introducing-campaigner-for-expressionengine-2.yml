# Introducing Campaigner for ExpressionEngine 2 #
I first released Campaigner (then SL Freshview Subscribe) back in 2008. In ExpressionEngine terms those were wild and dangerous times, pre-dating such cultural touchstones as [(FF) Matrix](http://pixelandtonic.com/matrix/ "Bait and switch, bitches"), [Structure](http://buildwithstructure.com/ "EE without all that annoying EEness"), and [Jamie Rumbelow](http://bit.ly/9gnDPv "I hope you're not lactose intolerant, because the next word is 'dairy'").

In the intervening years, I've rewritten Campaigner (twice), and become incredibly wealthy and popular due to its fame and commercial success.

Perhaps not surprisingly, my adoring public wanted more. It's a damned imposition, certainly, but I recognise and understand your desperate longing in ways even you don't fully comprehend.

So here it is, my sweet devoted minions: [Campaigner for ExpressionEngine 2](/software/campaigner "Finally, a reason to upgrade"). Completely rewritten, exhaustively tested, available today.

## Huh? ##
For those of you who have been stuck using WordPress (25 million people can't be wrong&trade;) for the past 2 years, Campaigner makes it easy to subscribe members of your ExpressionEngine site to [Campaign Monitor](http://campaignmonitor.com/ "Like MailChimp, with added Australian") mailing lists.

It fully supports all the [ExpressionEngine account activation options](http://expressionengine.com/user_guide/cp/members/membership_preferences.html "ExpressionEngine documentation for 'Membership preferences'"), and even works if you go all power crazy, and start registering new members [via the Control Panel](http://expressionengine.com/user_guide/cp/members/new_member_registration.html "ExpressionEngine documentation for 'Register a new member'").

On top of that, you can specify an optional "trigger" for each mailing list, enabling members to select (that's "opt-in" for all you e-marketing folk) which lists they wish to join.

Hell, if you've got [User](http://solspace.com/software/detail/user/ "Taking up EllisLab's slack since 2008") installed, your site members can even _update_ their Campaign Monitor subscription preferences directly from your site. I know, even I was impressed by that last one.

So there you go, [Campaigner for ExpressionEngine 2](/software/campaigner "Campaign Monitor and EE, sitting in a tree"). Buy it, and quit bugging me about [BucketList](/software/bucketlist "Patience").
