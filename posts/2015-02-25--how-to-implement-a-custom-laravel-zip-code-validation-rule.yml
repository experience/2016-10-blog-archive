# How to Implement a Custom Laravel Zip Code Validation Rule #
The following class[^note_to_self] makes a new `zip` validation rule available to your Laravel[^laravel_4] validators. It validates 5-digit U.S. postal codes, and the [ZIP+4 format][plus_four_codes].

[^note_to_self]: As with much on this blog, this post is essentially a note to self. I'm sure I've written this class--or something very similar--multiple times, and it seems unlikely I'll ever get around to creating a package for it. Hopefully the next time I need to validate a zip code in Laravel, Google will remind me of the existence of this blog post.

[^laravel_4]: Tested in Laravel 4.2.

[plus_four_codes]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_code#ZIP.2B4 "A not-brief-enough history of zip codes"

```php
<?php namespace Path\To\Validators;

use Illuminate\Validation\Validator;

class ZipValidator extends Validator
{
    public function validateZip($attribute, $value, $parameters)
    {
        return preg_match('/^[0-9]{5}(\-[0-9]{4})?$/', $value);
    }
}
```


Store the `ZipValidator` class in a location of your choosing (making sure to set the `namespace` accordingly), and [tell Laravel about its existence][register_validator].

[register_validator]: http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/validation#custom-validation-rules "Check it, Laravel"

Example usage:

```php
$rules = [
    'postcode' => ['required', 'zip'],
];
```
