# Introducing Template OmniLogger #
Yesterday, [Michael Rog][rog_twitter] released [Template OmniLogger][to_docs], a neat little plugin that makes it possible to create [OmniLog][omnilog] entries using a template tag.

This could prove very useful for template debugging, and ties in quite neatly with some of the OmniLog updates I've been working on recently.

Michael has generously given me permission to roll Template OmniLogger's functionality into the next release of OmniLog; in the meantime check out [the Template OmniLogger repo][to_repo] and [documentation][to_docs].
