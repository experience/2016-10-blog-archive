# Never Forget the Big Picture #
I touched on this subject [a couple of weeks ago](/blog/archive/niche-market-web-site "Read the story of Jones the Boot"), but it's something that bears repeating.

**Your web site is only there to serve your business. If it doesn't contribute to your business goals, then it's a waste of money.**

Take a quick look at your competitor's web sites (and maybe your own), and you'll soon realise that this is one of those obvious statements that most companies ignore.

It's true that many web sites have elements that don't *directly* earn their keep, but still contribute to the site as a whole. So yes, maybe omitting the "About Us" page containing a two-thousand word history of your business really will result in lost sales.

Or maybe you'll just save a load of time and money that could be better used elsewhere.

Before you invest any further in your web site, consider whether what you're about to do will help your business to achieve its goals.

If the answer is no, do something else. The chances are nobody will miss it anyway.
