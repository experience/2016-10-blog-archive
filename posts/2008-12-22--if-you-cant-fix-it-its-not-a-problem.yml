# If You Can&#039;t Fix It, It&#039;s Not A Problem #
Last night I finished reading the excellent [No Country For Old Men](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Country-Old-Men-Cormac-McCarthy/dp/0330454536/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229942612&sr=1-1 "No Country For Old Men, for sale at Amazon.co.uk") by Cormac McCarthy. It's littered with gems of dialogue, but I particularly enjoyed this one:

> I've told my deputies more than once that you fix what you can fix and you let the rest go. If there aint nothin to be done about it it aint even a problem. It's just a aggravation.-- Cormac McCarthy, "No Country For Old Men" 

In business, as in life, it pays to pick your fights.
