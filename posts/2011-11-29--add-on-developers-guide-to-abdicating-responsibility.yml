# The Add-on Developer&#039;s Guide to Abdicating Responsibility #
The ability to add custom extension hooks to your add-on is one of the most powerful features of ExpressionEngine. It is also woefully under-used by most add-on developers.

There are three main reasons for implementing custom extension hooks in your add-ons:

1. To let your PHP-savvy users bend your add-on to their will without resorting to nasty hacks;
2. To prevent code and feature bloat;
3. To facilitate code re-use and easier maintenance, by building multiple related add-ons, instead of a single Ã¼ber add-on.

The final point is particularly relevant to private projects, where you don't have to worry about the additional support requests that may result from requiring end-users to install multiple discreet add-ons.

This post expands on the first two points.

## Without X your add-on is USELESS!
Not all feature requests are created equal. Some are extremely insightful and far-reaching, and improve the add-on in ways you never imagined. Most are narrow, case-specific, and don't belong in the core product.

Extension hooks provide a means of dealing with the latter in a way that doesn't adversely affect the core add-on.

Allow me to furnish you with an example.

## The problem
[Campaigner][campaigner] is an ExpressionEngine 2 extension which automatically adds newly registered members of an ExpressionEngine site to the [Campaign Monitor][campaign_monitor] mailing lists of your choosing.

One of Campaigner's most-used features is the ability to [set a "trigger"][campaigner_trigger] for each mailing list. A trigger is simply a condition which states "member field X must contain value Y". If this condition is met, the member is subscribed to the associated Campaign Monitor mailing list.

For example, you may decide that you're only interested in members who select "Blue" in answer to the question "What is your favourite colour?".

In this case Campaigner will check the `m_favorite_color` custom member field (or whatever you've called it) for the string "Blue". All pretty simple stuff.

But what if the question is "What are your preferred colour(s)?", and the member has the option of choosing from a series of checkboxes?

This presents Campaigner with a real problem. If the member selects more than one colour the "trigger" condition will fail, even if one of the selected values is "Blue".

Even worse, the selected values could be stored in the database as: a comma, pipe, or line-break delimited string; a serialised array; some other fanciful concoction of which I've never even heard.

In other words, there's no way to reliably implement a universal solution that will work for all the possible variations of this problem.

This is where an extension hook can prove invaluable.

## The solution
[Campaigner 4.3.0][campaigner_430] introduced the `campaigner_should_subscribe_member` hook, largely in response to a number of feature requests related to this problem.

The hook enables a third-party add-on to cleanly override Campaigner's internal logic governing whether a member should be subscribed to Campaign Monitor.

I used the `campaigner_should_subscribe_member` hook in [Campaigner Multi-Select][campaigner_ms], a stand-alone extension which solved the original feature request. Those who need to support multi-value fields can install Campaigner MS; life continues as normal for the majority who don't.

While it may sound like more work than is strictly necessary, there are two big advantages to this solution:

1. The Campaigner code-base remains free of unnecessary cruft, resulting in easier maintenance;
2. _Anyone_ may now override Campaigner's internal "trigger" logic, making for a more flexible and useful add-on.

## Conclusion
Custom extension hooks are an excellent way to make your add-ons more flexible, whilst avoiding code bloat. Even the [simplest add-ons][smartdown_hooks] can benefit from a custom hook or two.
