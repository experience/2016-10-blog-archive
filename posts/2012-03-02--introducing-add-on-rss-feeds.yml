# Introducing Add-on RSS Feeds #
A little treat for all you add-on addicts out there: each of my add-ons now has its own changelog RSS feed.

Just point your preferred RSS reader to `/software/feeds/{addon_name}/`, and you're done.

For example, [the RSS changelog feed for Campaigner][campaigner_feed] is at `/software/feeds/campaigner`.

## Group hug
This is moderately handy in its own right, but was primarily motivated by my decision to add [NSM Addon Updater][nsm_addon_updater] support to all of my add-ons.

[OmniLog 1.5.0][omnilog_150] was first to benefit from my new-found desire to play nicely with others. My other add-ons will follow suit as and when I release a new version.

[campaigner_feed]:/software/feeds/campaigner "Join my loop"
[nsm_addon_updater]:http://ee-garage.com/nsm-addon-updater "All your Kylies are belong to us"
[omnilog_150]:/software/omnilog/changelog#v1.5.0 "The guinea pig"
