# Introducing Campaigner #
Today is a big day for one of my most popular add-ons.

SL Freshview Subscribe has been connecting ExpressionEngine with Campaign Monitor since 2008. It's now reached version 2.0, and been given a brand new name: [Campaigner](/software/campaigner "Campaigner: connecting ExpressionEngine and Campaign Monitor").

Campaigner has been [completely rewritten](/software/campaigner/changelog "Read the Campaigner release notes") from the ground up, with a bevy of new features, and a revamped user interface.

It's also now a commercial product, with a license fee of $15 per site.

## On being a capitalist pig-dog ##
I didn't take the decision to start charging for Campaigner lightly.

The license is an attempt to cover ongoing support, and make it easier for me to justify future development of this add-on, including an ExpressionEngine 2 compatible version.

The observant among you may have noticed that previous versions of Campaigner (and many of my other add-ons) included a "Donate Now" button.

"What about all those generous souls who filled your coffers with their charitable contributions?", you may reasonably demand.

In 3 years, I've received around $100 in donations, across _all_ of my add-ons.

If you were one of those generous individuals, you have my heartfelt thanks. Your support helped get me this far, and I truly appreciate it.

However, it has become very apparent that relying on the charity of others isn't going to keep the wolf from the door.

## Is this the end of free? ##
So what does this mean for my other add-ons?

Nothing.

Some of them may become commercial add-ons in the future, depending on their ongoing support requirements, and the amount of work it will take to update them. Most of them won't.

I've benefitted greatly from being part of the ExpressionEngine community, both from the add-ons others have released for free, and from the opportunities it has afforded me.

By releasing free add-ons, I hoped to give something back to a community that has been very good to me.

I intend to continue doing so wherever possible, whilst also releasing a few commercial add-ons to cover some of the support and development costs.

It's a balancing act, and one which I may struggle to get right from time-to-time, but I'm sure we'll find a happy medium sooner or later.

## Future plans ##
I haven't made any firm decisions regarding those "may become commercial add-ons" I mentioned, but [SL Google Map](/software/sl-google-map "Google Maps and ExpressionEngine, sitting in a tree") and [SL Combinator](/software/sl-combinator "Combine and compress CSS and JavaScript files, on the fly") are two prime candidates. They're certainly both in desperate need of attention, probably of the "complete rewrite" variety.

If you don't like the sound of that, feel free to download them now, and squirrel them away on your hard-drive for future use.

## A quick word about SL MailChimp Subscribe ##
Those of you in the MailChimp camp are probably scrabbling for the download button right now, fearing that I may be about to start charging for [SL MailChimp Subscribe](/software/sl-mailchimp-subscribe "Integrate MailChimp with your ExpressionEngine website").

Cease your feverish panicking you paranoid tightwad.

The original development of SL MailChimp Subscribe was sponsored by the good people at MailChimp. They've also been sponsoring work on an ExpressionEngine 2 compatible version, so there's no need to worry about that particular add-on selling out any time soon.

## Questions? Abuse? ##
If you have any questions about Campaigner, or my add-on development plans in general, please let me know.

You can get in touch via [the contact form](/contact "Drop me a line"), or  publicly abuse me [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/monooso/ "Follow me on Twitter").

Finally, in the run-up to the release of Campaigner, a couple of people posted support requests for SL Freshview Subscribe.

I've contacted them directly, and provided each with a free copy Campaigner. If you posted a support request that I somehow managed to overlook, [let me know](/contact "Get in touch"), and I'll do the same for you.
