# Speaking At EEUK 2011 #
Over the weekend, I finally got around to sorting out the topic for my [EEUK][eeuk_a] talk: "Commercial Add-on Development for Private Clients". On reflection, I probably could have phrased it a bit more seductively.

I'll be dropping some hard-earned knowledge that will make your add-on development life that little bit easier. If you don't have an add-on development life, you clearly need to get out less.

My presence notwithstanding, [EEUK][eeuk_b] is shaping up to be a cracking conference, with some excellent speakers, and a rather splendid venue. EllisLab have even seen fit to [unleash the Flinger][flinger] for the event; the effect this will have on ticket sales is still unclear.

[eeuk_b]: http://eeuk.org/ "EECI with all the bad bits taken out. And by bad bits I mean Americans"

If you've been to a <strike>Harvester</strike> EE conference before, you don't need me to tell you that an excellent time is had by all. We're fortunate to be part of a great community, full of smart, interesting [drunks][flinger_a] and [degenerates][flinger_b], which is exactly what you need at a conference.

[flinger_b]: http://www.flickr.com/photos/natecroft/5074295894/in/pool-1414877@N20/ "Don't be fooled. She can turn on you at a moment's notice"

Plus, if you're based in the UK or Europe, EEUK is your best chance to attend an ExpressionEngine conference this year. If you haven't done so already, [bag yourself a ticket][ticket] before they're all gone.
