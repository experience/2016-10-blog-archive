# SL Developer Info for ExpressionEngine 2 #
Many years ago, I scratched my own ExpressionEngine itch by building [SL Developer Info][sl_developer_info]. SL Developer Info collects all the information you typically need when developing an ExpressionEngine site, and displays it in one convenient location.

Recently, I have heard reports that some of you are moving to a new-fangled content management system entitled "ExpressionEngine 2." I have also received requests for an updated version of SL Developer Info that plays nicely with this young pretender. My irrational fear of change clearly precluded such an undertaking, and I resolutely ignored the peanut gallery's pleas.

Thankfully for all concerned, [Marc Miller][marc_miller] stepped into the breach, creating [Developer Info for ExpressionEngine 2][developer_info].
