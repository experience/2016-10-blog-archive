# The Client Guide to Web Standards #
The term "Web Standards" covers several related guidelines and technologies, which together define the best way to build a web site.

Web Standards separate a web site into three elements:

1. Structure and content.
2. Appearance.
3. Enhancements (for example, automatic form validation).

This separation is sometimes referred to as the "Three Legged Stool", and has many advantages. Here are just a few:

- _Easy maintenance_. Changing the colour of the links or headings on your site requires a single update to the appearance "leg".
- _A wider audience_. Devices that don't understand the appearance and enhancements "legs" (such as most mobile phones) can still display the content "leg".
- _An accessible web site_. The separation of content from appearance and enhancements is a great first step to making a web site accessible to people with disabilities. As well as being a legal requirement, an accessible web site means more potential customers for your business.
- _Search engine friendly_. Search engines such as Google are only interested in the content of your site. Web Standards remove the distractions of appearance and enhancements, which can improve your search engine rankings.

## Common terms
Chances are you'll hear the following terms mentioned a lot when discussing Web Standards:

HTML
: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used for the "structure" leg.

XHTML
: XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) is an alternative to HTML.

CSS
: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for the "appearance" leg. HTML and CSS can be mixed in the same document, but this is to be avoided wherever possible.

JavaScript
: Finally, something that isn't an acronym. JavaScript is used for the enhancements leg. Important functionality, such as site navigation, should not be reliant upon JavaScript.
