# Carbon Neutral Web Sites #
We try to conduct our business in an environmentally-friendly manner. We do all the obvious things, like recycling paper (after using both sides), not leaving computers on overnight, and so forth, but I'm the first to admit that I'm no expert in these matters.

As with most topics, the sheer volume of information available via the internet is more of a curse than a blessing. Everyone has an opinion, and these days determining credibility is extremely difficult, unless you already happen to be an expert on the subject. The term vicious circle was invented for such situations.

I digress.

The purpose of this post is to mention a company that provides [carbon offsetting for web sites](http://www.coco2.org/ "Carbon offsetting services for web sites and mobile phones") (or, more precisely, the servers on which a web site resides). Unsurprisingly, there's much argument about [whether carbon offsetting is even a good thing](http://www.cheatneutral.com/ "A brilliant carbon offsetting spoof"), but getting into such a debate just leads us straight back to my previous point.

We've decided to include this with every web site we build. It's only a few quid out of our pocket, and we get to feel nice and conscientious as a result, which is a pretty good deal in my book.

The apparent shortcomings of carbon offsetting may mean that this is little more than a gesture, but we like to think that it's better than doing nothing, which is what we were doing before.

If you have your own web site, or indeed build them for other people, you might want to [consider doing the same](http://www.coco2.org/list_my_site.php "Make your web site carbon neutral").
