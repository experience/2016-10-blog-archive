# Speaking at EECI 2010 #
The website is up, [tickets are on sale](http://eeciconf.com/eu/tickets/ "Grab an EECI early-bird ticket."), and I can finally liberate this damned cat. This September, I'll be speaking at the [ExpressionEngine CodeIgniter Conference](http://eeciconf.com/ "EEstock.") in Leiden, alongside the great and the good of the ExpressionEngine community, and [Kenny Meyers](http://kennymeyers.com/ "Vanilla bear.").

[Robert](http://twitter.com/roberteerhart "Where did he find the time to breed?") was kind enough to ask me a few months back, before the San Francisco EECI Conference in fact, so I've been biting my tongue for a while now.

Of some surprise to you and me both is the fact that I'm the [first lamb to the slaughter](http://www.eeciconf.com/eu/program/ "First off the boat at Normandy.") on day 1, directly after the opening keynote. This must be what the guy following Steve Jobs at the WWDC feels like.

So [grab yourself an early-bird ticket](http://eeciconf.com/eu/tickets/ "Awesomeness, but cheaper."), and abate your breath in anticipation of more exciting updates, as I attempt to decide what the hell I'm going to talk about.
