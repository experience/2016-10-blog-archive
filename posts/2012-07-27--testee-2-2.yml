# Testee 2.2 #
Yesterday I released Testee 2.2, which contains a significant[^1] new feature: [automated testing][auto_docs].

You can now run an add-on's test suite by loading an "ACTion" URL; Testee does your bidding, and returns the results as JSON:

```javascript
// Run the Testee test suite.
http://example.com?ACT=101&addon=testee
	
// JSON response.
{
    "summary": {
        "result": "failed",
        "pass_count": "100",
        "error_count": "0",
        "exception_count": "0",
        "fail_count": "0",
        "skip_count": "0"
    },
    "errors": [],
    "exceptions": [],
    "fails": [],
    "skips": []
}
```


This is particularly handy if you use any sort of build process, or want to automatically run your test suite every time you make a Git commit (for example).

[Check out the documentation][auto_docs] for comprehensive information on using this new feature.

[auto_docs]: /software/testee/docs/testee-automated-testing/ "Includes HTTP Response Status Codes, and everything"

[^1]: Or possibly completely insignificant, if you have no interest in unit testing ExpressionEngine add-ons.
