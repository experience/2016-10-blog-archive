# Design Principles #
It's been a good few years since I earned my living as a designer. These days, I spend my time moving bits of code around the screen, rather than pixels.

Whilst sorting through some old files today, I came across a document pretentiously entitled "Design Principles". I have no idea when I wrote this document, but it's aged surprisingly well.

What was most surprising to me, however, was that these "principles" are as applicable to my current development life as they were to my previous design life.

1. The only way to judge the success of a design is against clearly defined, measurable goals.
2. There is no "one true design" for any given problem, or set of problems. As such, the only workable approach is to use experience, best judgement, research, and data to arrive at a "best guess" solution (it would disingenuous to describe it otherwise) within the project constraints.
3. It follows that there is no such thing as a finishing line; everything can be improved, given enough time, effort, money, skill, and data. Learn, iterate, repeat.
4. Aesthetics matter, but they're not the solution. This is design, not art: if you have an overwhelming need to express your creativity, do so elsewhere.
5. Inspiration is elusive and overrated. Hard work, focus, and a clear sense of direction win every time.
6. The best way to consistently produce good work is to follow a process that works _for you_. Notice what works, ditch what doesn't, and never stop trying new things.
