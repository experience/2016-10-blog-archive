# Announcing Hull Digital Live 2010 #
[Jon Moss](http://twitter.com/jonmoss/ "Follow the pimp daddy"), the Humberside Hefner, has taken some time off from international love-god duties to organise the second annual [Hull Digital Live conference](http://hd-live.co.uk/ "The HD Live conference website. It's made with HTML5 and stuff").

The speaker list is yet to be announced, but the word on the street is that this year's line-up is even more impressive than [the talent buffet](http://www.hdlive09.co.uk/speakers "TED for the rest of us") that graced last year's inaugural event.

Schedule details and early-bird tickets will be arriving shortly, so head on over to the conference website and show your support for LL Cool Jon by [registering for updates](http://hd-live.co.uk/ "Get on the pimp list"). Those silk pyjamas don't come cheap you know.
