# Ready to Serve #
During a recent lunchtime excursion, I happened across a "customer comments" card at [Pret](http://www.pret.com/ "Visit Pret on the web").

The reverse of the card is fairly standard fare, inviting comments and suggestions from customers. It even features an [annoying tick-box to opt-out](/blog/archive/opt-out-stupidity "The stupidity of the opt-out checkbox") of future communications.

The front of the card, however, makes a pleasant change to the faceless anonymity of the typical "Customer Care" department. Here's the text, in full.

> My name is Lina Dimino. I'm the Manager at this Pret shop.

My team and I meet every morning.

We discuss the comments you've made, the good, the bad and the ugly. If we can deal with it ourselves, we will.

If we can't, I'll forward this card to Julian Metcalfe back at the office. I know he'll do what he can.

If you have a minute, please do ask to speak to me or one of my team right now.

By using the names of the managers, instead of hiding behind legions of McJobbers with name badges and no power to affect change, Pret is making itself accountable, an act of which [I thoroughly approve](/why-hire/accountable/ "We also make ourselves accountable to our web design clients").
