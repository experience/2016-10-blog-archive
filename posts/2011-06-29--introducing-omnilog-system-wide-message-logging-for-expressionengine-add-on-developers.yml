# Introducing OmniLog: System-Wide Message Logging for ExpressionEngine Add-on Developers #
Yesterday, I--along with the rest of the known ExpressionEngine universe--spent some time kissing [Brandon Kelly's Assets][assets].

[assets]: http://pixelandtonic.com/assets "No way! EllisLab were totally just about to do something exactly like this"

As I waited patiently for the file to upload to my preferred warez site, I impudently pondered what could possibly be done to make Brandon Kelly's <strike>life a living hell</strike> add-on even better.

And then, like an "upload complete" notification written entirely in Russian, it hit me: [Assets][assets_b] should tell me when a problem occurs deep in the bowels of its <strike>ropey</strike> flawless code.

[assets_b]: http://pixelandtonic.com/assets "Sometimes I think Brandon Kelly could release some overpriced piece of crap breadcrumbs module, and people would still buy it"

Surely this would be of great benefit not only to me, his Kellyship's humble customer, but also [Our Underbearded Overlord][underbeard] Himself, on those rare occasions when a misguided fool submits a "doesn't work, fix it" support request.

I decided it was time to help a brother out, and set to work. Several hours later, I am happy to present [OmniLog][omnilog]: a system-wide message logging add-on, specifically designed for use by ExpressionEngine add-on developers.

As I type this, it also occurs to me that [OmniLog][omnilog] ties in rather nicely with the "log everything" directive, from [part 2][part_2] of my "Integrating ExpressionEngine with Third-Party APIs" series.

Isn't life full of strange coincidences? Don't bother answering that, I still haven't enabled comments.
