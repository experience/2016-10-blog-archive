# Interviewed at Meta Q #
A few months ago, I received an email from Lindsay at [Meta Q][meta_q_home], asking if I'd be interested in answering a few questions for their [ongoing series of interviews][meta_qa] with people from the [ExpressionEngine][ee] community.

Being a complete fame-whore, I naturally jumped at the chance, pouring my heart out in response to such probing questions as "Tell us about your work in 140 characters or less."

I hit "Send", and spent the next 12 weeks CMD-R-ing the MetaQ homepage.

Today, said interview has [finally been published][interview], and once the nice people at Meta Q have unblocked my I.P. address, I plan to spend the next few minutes reminding myself of my answers.

I encourage you to [join me][interview].
