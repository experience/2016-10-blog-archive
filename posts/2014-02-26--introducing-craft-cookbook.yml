# Introducing Craft Cookbook #
![The Craft Cookbook home page.](https://d1ku3pk0j9a2g6.cloudfront.net/blog/2014-02-26-craftcookbook-home.jpg?mtime=20150726160155)

We're big fans of [the Craft content management system][craft_home] here at Experience. Craft is a fine product under very active development, and despite [its youth][craft_birthday] it's well documented, and extremely well supported.

As with most things, building a site with Craft involves a bit of a learning curve. In this case, though, the learning curve presents novice users with a bit of a problem:

1. Googling for advice on "Craft" is an exercise in frustration, and more likely to result in a new-found love of crochet than an answer to your current CMS-based question.
2. [The documentation][craft_docs]--whilst excellent--is more about high-level concepts than the quick solutions you need when you're just getting started.
3. [The official Google+ group][craft_googleplus] is packed with useful information, but it's difficult to find (oh the irony), and painful to bookmark.

[craft_googleplus]: https://plus.google.com/communities/106505340287442511226 "The official Craft Google+ Group"

We found ourselves longing for a site which provided quick solutions to common Craft problems; something that would help us get to a working solution, fast, and remove some of the roadblocks to learning Craft.

So we built it.

## Quick solutions to your Craft problems
[Craft Cookbook][cookbook_home] is a home for task-oriented Craft "recipes".

[cookbook_home]: http://craftcookbook.net "The place to go for a quick solution to your Craft problem"

Each recipe follows the format defined by the [O'Reilly cookbooks][oreilly_cookbook], and comprises:

[oreilly_cookbook]: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1Shx_VXS6ioC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false "Problem, solution, discussion, done"

- A succinct description of the problem;
- A no-nonsense solution which you can quickly implement, and get on with your day;
- Additional content, for those who want to know the _why_ as well as the _how_ (where applicable).

For example, here's [how to add a file extension to your Craft URLs][cookbook_exampleRecipe].

[cookbook_exampleRecipe]: http://craftcookbook.net/recipes/adding-an-extension-to-craft-urls "A recipe for adding an extension to Craft URLs"

## Get involved (please)
Right now the Craft Cookbook includes around half-a-dozen [recipes][cookbook_recipes] we unearthed whilst browsing the Google+ group, or building our first few Craft sites.

[cookbook_recipes]: http://craftcookbook.net/recipes "The full list of Craft Cookbook recipes"

We'll continue to add recipes as we encounter them, but our hope is that the Craft community as a whole gets behind Craft Cookbook, and uses it to share their wisdom.

Together, we can make Craft Cookbook into a really valuable community resource, and drastically lower the barrier to entry for those new to the wonderful world of Craft (and Twig, and Yii).

So please, [get involved][cookbook_join].

## What does Experience get out of this?
Nothing, probably. We're not seeking to monetise Craft Cookbook, and anybody who submits a recipe will receive full credit for their contribution[^1].

We just like to support good products and people, and Craft ticks both of those boxes.

## What does Pixel and Tonic think of all this?
We contacted P&T back when we first had the idea for Craft Cookbook, to check they were happy for us to proceed.

Perhaps not surprisingly, [Brad was drunk][twitter_brad] and unavailable for comment, but Brandon gave us the go-ahead. In a brief moment of clarity, Brad later confessed that he didn't hate the idea.

[twitter_brad]: https://twitter.com/search?q=drink%20from%3Aangrybrad&src=typd "Father Jack"

We greatly appreciate the encouragement, and also the free Package licenses which P&T generously provided.

Now [go share your knowledge][cookbook_join].

[^1]: For the initial launch this means a simple "authored by" credit. The plan is to expand this over time, to accommodate a full profile and bragging rights.
