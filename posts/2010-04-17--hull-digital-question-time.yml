# Hull Digital Question Time #
If you, like me, have long felt that discussions about the future of online media are sorely lacking a vicious fight to the death, salvation is at hand.

Humberside's one-man answer to the Dimbleby brothers, [Jon Moss](http://hulldigital.co.uk/ "Visit the Hull Digital website"), has worked his magic yet again, and on May 26th Hull University will be transformed into a present-day Colosseum for the inaugural [Hull Digital Question Time](http://www.hdqt.co.uk/ "Visit the official Hull Digital Question Time website").

Playing the part of sacrificial Christians will be a panel of lauded luminaries from the fields of business, technology, and academia. In a desperate attempt to earn a pardoning thumbs-up from Emperor Moss, these assembled experts will field questions from the baying crowd, before turning on each other in a frantic cage fight to the death[^1].

[Register now](http://www.amiando.com/hdqt.html "Buy tickets for Hull Digital Question Time"), for what will surely be an unforgettable experience, and the last public act of all involved.

[^1]: Event may not include cages, fighting, or death.
