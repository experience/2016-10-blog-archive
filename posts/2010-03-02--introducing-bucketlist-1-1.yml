# Introducing BucketList 1.1 #
A little over a month ago, we released our first commercial ExpressionEngine add-on, [BucketList](/bucketlist "Seamless integration of ExpressionEngine with Amazon S3"), a fieldtype which seamlessly integrates Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3) with your ExpressionEngine website.

The response was fantastic, with BucketList receiving mad props (as the young people like to say) from such luminous EE flagships as [EE Insider](http://eeinsider.com/blog/bucketlist-launches/ "Visit EE Insider"), and the [ExpressionEngine Podcast](http://5by5.tv/eepodcast/11 "Listen to the EE Podcast").

Version 1.1 is the first significant update to BucketList, and introduces what has been by far the most-requested feature; the ability to control which buckets are available for each field, or FF Matrix cell.

We have lots more planned for BucketList over the coming months, so if you'd like to stay informed, sign up to our newsletter using the form below, or [subscribe to our RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/experience-internet-blog "Subscribe to the Experience Internet RSS feed.").
