# Introducing Testee: Unit Testing for ExpressionEngine Add-ons #
Way back in October of last year, I took the stage at [EECI 2010 in Leiden][eeci] and spoke at nauseating length on the subject of test-driven add-on development. As part of that talk, I officially announced [Testee][testee_home], an EE1 and EE2 module that makes it possible to unit test your ExpressionEngine add-ons.

Since then, this hilariously-named add-on has been sitting idly in [my GitHub account][github], silently rebuking me over its lack of documentation.

Today those mute recriminations can finally cease; [Testee has an official home][testee_home] alongside my other EE add-ons, with [documentation][testee_docs] to match.

If your current add-on development process revolves around the evil-E trifecta of `echo`, `error_log`, and `exit`, I strongly recommend you take a look at [test-driven development][tdd], and Testee. Combined, they've improved the quality of my code more than anything else I've tried.

[Let me know][contact] how you get on.
