# Sitting Pretty at the Interactive Media Awards #
Break out the bubbly, we've just been awarded a prestigious [Best in Class Interactive Media Award](http://www.interactivemediaawards.com/winners/certificate.asp?param=55073&cat=1 "See our award on the IMA web site") for IconicInteriors.com.

Aaron Warner of the Interactive Media Awards summed up the achievement thusly:

> The Best in Class award is the highest honor bestowed by the Interactive Media Awards. It represents the very best in planning, execution and overall professionalism. [It is] an achievement only a fraction of sites in the IMA competition earn each year.-- Aaron Warner, Interactive Media Awards 

The IMAs are judged by a panel of industry experts from companies such as American Express, Microsoft, and Time Warner. We scored an exceptional **494 out of a possible 500** for the Iconic Interiors web site, earning us not only the "Best in Class" award, but also an excellent chance of inclusion in the IMAs coveted "Best Sites of the Year" list.

Iconic Interiors founder, Mark Holdsworth, is delighted with his company's new web site:

> We launched the site in April and it has already paid for itself, so we knew we had a winner on our hands. This award is the icing on the cake.-- Mark Holdsworth, Founder of Iconic Interiors 

Previous winners of the IMA "Best in Class" award include some of the world's top interactive agencies, producing web sites for companies such as adidas, Dell, BMW, and Pepsi.

As you might expect, we're really pleased with the recognition the Iconic site is receiving. The best news is that there could be more to come--IconicInteriors.com has been nominated for another big-name award, as has [the Lab.gruppen web site](http://www.labgruppen.com/ "Visit the Lab.gruppen web site"), which we launched in June.
