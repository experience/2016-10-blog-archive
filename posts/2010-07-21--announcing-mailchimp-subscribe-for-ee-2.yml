# Announcing MailChimp Subscribe for ExpressionEngine 2 #
[MailChimp Subscribe 2.0.0](/software/mailchimp-subscribe "Go ape. Or something. Seriously, I've got nothing") is out, bringing with it [ExpressionEngine 2](http://expressionengine.com/ "ExpressionEngine 2. Like ExpressionEngine 1 but with JavaScript and bugs. Awesome!") compatibility. Finally, you can all upgrade. Seriously, I should charge EllisLab commission for this stuff.

The [official documentation](/software/mailchimp-subscribe "Read the documentation or I will hunt you down like a dog") has all the gory details, along with the all-important download link. If you're just a Linux gal who can't say no, the GitHub repositories are [here (EE 1)](http://github.com/experience/sl.mailchimp_subscribe.ee_addon "This one goes out to the Boyink massive"), and [here (EE 2)](http://github.com/experience/sl.mailchimp_subscribe.ee2_addon "Please do not visit if you suffer from an irrational fear of 'Download Source' buttons").

In addition to the epoch shafting news of EE 2 support, I've also allowed the EE 1 version of MailChimp Subscribe one last grand hurrah, with a shiny new <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr>.

If you discover a bug in the EE 1 version of MailChimp Subscribe which causes the deletion of the internet and the death of a loved one, by all means [let me know](http://support.experienceinternet.co.uk/discussions/mailchimp_subscribe/ "Official MailChimp Subscribe support") and I'll fix it. Other than that, I won't be making any further updates to EE 1 branch.
