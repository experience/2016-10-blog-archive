# A Healthy Business Alliance #
It's rare that I bother reading the junk mail I receive. It's exceptionally rare that I put said junk mail in a safe place, with the express intention of blogging about it.

The piece of junk mail that brought about such unusual behaviour landed on my doormat a couple of weeks ago, courtesy of [PruHealth insurance](http://www.whypayforthegym.com "Why pay for the gym?").

This letter survived the short, inevitable trip to the recycling bin by virtue of the following opening gambit: _Go to the gym twice a week and soon you could go for free._

The pitch is that PruHealth will subsidise your membership to [Cannons](http://www.cannons.co.uk/ "Visit the Cannons web site"), [LA Fitness](http://www.lafitness.co.uk/ "Visit the LA Fitness web site"), and most [UK Virgin Active](http://www.virginactive.co.uk/ "Visit the Virgin Active web site") gyms. All you have to do is turn up a couple of times a week, and break a sweat. Presumably, you could also just sit in the bar, but they don't mention that in the letter.

It's a great idea, because everybody wins. The health insurance company gets fitter, healthier customers, which is exactly what a health insurer wants. The gyms get access to an enormous database of people with an interest in their personal health and fitness, which is exactly what a gym wants. And the customers get a rather nice freebie, which is pretty much what we all want.

It's a perfect example of companies forming a mutually beneficial alliance, and working together to offer something that is far greater than the sum of its parts.

How can your business do the same?
