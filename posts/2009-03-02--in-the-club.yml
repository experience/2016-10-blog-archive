# In the Club #
Groucho Marx once [famously quipped](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Groucho_Marx "More from the great Groucho") that <q>I don't want to belong to any club that will accept people like me as a member</q>.

I'm clearly a little less picky, having just become a proud member of the [ExpressionEngine Professionals Network](http://expressionengine.com/professionals/ "View the ExpressionEngine Professionals Network") (smoking jacket optional).

For non-Grouchos a bit of validation by your peers is always nice, especially for small outfits like Experience. I'm also crossing my fingers for an early look at EE2.0 sometime soon, now that I'm in the club (cue excited giggling).
